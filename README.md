# React Tic Tac Toe with Time Travel

This project is a React-based Tic Tac Toe game featuring a unique "time travel" functionality. Players can step back to any previous move in the game, allowing them to view or replay specific points in the match.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production in the `build` folder, optimizing it for performance. Your app will be ready for deployment!

### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation.** Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back! This command allows full customization by copying configuration files and dependencies directly into your project. Use only if you need to modify the build tool configuration.
